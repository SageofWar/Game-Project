Tic TAc Toe Game
The tic tac toe game was made using html, css and javascript.  The game uses the if else functions to determine the winner, and a class of "x", and "o" to determine ware the players have put there pieces. My main focus was trying to make the board look better with css elements to practice using it.



Problems I couldn't solve:
I wanted to use actual pictures instead of text elements for the board but I couldn't get them to scale properly,
I tried to make an AI player option but it kept breaking my code.
